# Changelog

## v3.2.1-dev (In Development / Roadmap)
- **Unified Core Asynchronous Runtime Provisioner & Responsive Dialog**:
  - Re-architected virtual environment creation and pip installation in `runtime_manager.py` with non-blocking subprocess polling and `threading.Event` cancellation.
  - Replaced blocking modal execution in `processing.py` with responsive threaded workers (`RuntimeSetupWorker` and `WhisperModelInstallWorker`), enabling seamless user cancellation without UI freezes or leaked background processes.
- **Whisper Hallucination & Degenerate Loop Scrubber**:
  - Implemented comprehensive transcript cleaning suite in `prs_shared.py` featuring n-gram repetition collapsing (`collapse_repeating_ngrams`), regex-based hallucination phrase pruning (`strip_hallucination_phrases`), and degenerate tail trimming (`trim_trailing_degenerate_tail`).
  - Integrated scrubber into transcription pipeline across `processing.py` and `radio_tv_story_segmenter_worker.py`.

## v3.2.0-dev
- **Subprocess & Worker Lifecycle Hardening (Windows Job Objects & POSIX Groups)**:
  - Bound the application and all child worker processes (`python.exe`, `ffmpeg.exe`, translation processes) to an OS Job Object (`JOB_OBJECT_LIMIT_KILL_ON_JOB_CLOSE`) on Windows and isolated process groups on POSIX. Prevents lingering orphan processes if the parent process crashes or is killed externally.
- **Translation Plugin Self-Containment & Pure CTranslate2 Engine**:
  - Removed legacy PyTorch and Transformers fallbacks from `plugins/translation/worker.py` and pruned `torch` from translation runtime dependencies. Model inference runs strictly through quantized `ctranslate2` and `sentencepiece`, dramatically shrinking memory footprint and installation overhead.
- **Emergency Project State Serialization & Crash Recovery**:
  - Enhanced global exception hooks in `playback_preferences.py` to atomically snapshot dirty projects to `.crash_recovery.rtvs` upon unhandled exceptions.
  - Added startup detection in `media_batch.py` (`restore_last_opened`) to prompt users to recover emergency crash snapshots if an unexpected termination occurs.
- **Download Integrity & Plugin Verification**:
  - Implemented cryptographic SHA-256 validation helpers in `prs_shared.py` and wired optional `expected_sha256` integrity checking into `plugins/manager.py`'s `install_addon`.
  - Hardened translation model downloads in `plugins/translation/worker.py` with HTTP status validation and support for pinned revisions.

## v3.1.6
- **Resolved Comment Shortcut (Ctrl+M) Conflict**:
  - Connected the global `add_comment_action` (`Ctrl+M`) to the MainWindow `add_comment_from_selection()` method instead of a non-existent transcript view method. This ensures that pressing `Ctrl+M` works globally across the application, whether the transcript view is focused or not, and eliminates silent shortcut collisions.
- **Prevented Duplicate Comment Creation**:
  - Restricted selection-based comments to exactly one primary segment target index in the comment editor dialog instead of copy-creating multiple independent comments when a selection boundary slightly overlaps adjacent segments. This ensures that clicking the comment button or using the shortcut adds exactly one comment per selection range.

## v3.1.5
- **Spacebar Play/Pause Restoration in Transcript Viewing Mode**:
  - Refined the global event filter inside `playback_preferences.py` to allow the Spacebar key to toggle play/pause when the transcript text editor is focused in read-only viewing mode, instead of acting as a "Page Down" key.
- **UNC Network Share Safe File/Autosave Replacement Fallback**:
  - Implemented `safe_replace` across all persistent save pathways (`prs_shared.py`, `playback_preferences.py`, and `model_management.py`) utilizing exponential retry backoff loops and write-stream file copy fallbacks. This completely resolves `WinError 5 Access is denied` permission blocks during auto-saves and manual project saves on Windows SMB/UNC network storage shares.
- **Plugin Archive Path Traversal & Zip Slip Security Hardening**:
  - Implemented safe path validation (`safe_extract_zip` & `safe_extract_tar`) across `plugins/manager.py` and `runtime_manager.py` to strictly sanitize archive target paths and prevent path traversal vulnerabilities.
  - Added cryptographic SHA-256 checksum verification for downloaded plugin archives and standalone runtime binaries prior to extraction.
- **Transactional Staged Plugin Installations**:
  - Re-architected plugin installation and update workflows to extract into temporary staging directories, perform manifest/file validation, and execute atomic folder swaps with automated rollback on failure.
- **Translation Runtime Decoupling & Pure Plugin Architecture**:
  - Isolated translation dependencies, fallbacks, and runtime models strictly inside `plugins/translation/`, stripping direct ML model fallbacks from core code paths.
- **Deterministic Provisioning State Machine**:
  - Converted runtime environment provisioning in `runtime_manager.py` to a formal state machine (`NOT_INSTALLED` -> `CREATING` -> `INSTALLING` -> `VALIDATING` -> `READY` / `BROKEN`) with standardized recovery paths.

## v3.1.4
- **Diarization & Missing Type Definition Corrections**:
  - Resolved `NameError: name 'Optional' is not defined` crash on program launch after clean installation by explicitly importing type definitions inside `transcript_story.py`.

## v3.1.3
- **Floating Selection Popup Initialization & Preference Enforcement**:
  - Ensured `TranscriptSelectionBubble` starts hidden upon widget initialization so the floating toolbar is never displayed at startup.
  - Enforced `show_floating_selection_toolbar` preference checks across `prs_shared.py`, `ui_layout.py`, and `playback_preferences.py` so that if disabled in Preferences, the floating toolbar is never displayed at startup or on text selection.
- **Deep-State Isolation for Universal Undo & Redo**:
  - Resolved `_clone_transcript_state` object reference sharing in `playback_preferences.py` and `prs_shared.py` using complete deep copies.
  - Pressing `Ctrl+Z` (Undo) or `Ctrl+Shift+Z` (Redo) now reliably restores removed highlights and deleted comments, auto-refreshing both transcript views and the sidebar comments panel.
- **Enhanced Contiguous Highlight Removal**:
  - Re-engineered `remove_highlight` to clear character background brushes and word/segment metadata across contiguous highlighted sections spanning multiple sentences or paragraphs.

## v3.1.2
- **Expanded Keyboard Shortcut Customization Suite**:
  - Registered all application functions across File, Edit, View, Tools, Settings, and Help menus, right-click context menus, and transcript editor views into the shortcut customization manager.
  - Added default keyboard shortcut bindings for **Export Project Archive (.zip)** (`Ctrl+Shift+E` / `Cmd+Shift+E`), **Redo** (`Ctrl+Shift+Z` / `Cmd+Shift+Z`), **Delete Comment** (`Ctrl+Alt+D`), **Remove Highlight** (`Ctrl+Alt+H`), **Add Selected Text to New Story** (`Ctrl+Alt+N`), **Play Selected Text** (`Ctrl+Space`), and **Clear Text Selection** (`Esc`).
- **Alphabetical & Category Shortcut Sorting**:
  - Enhanced the Keyboard Shortcut Customizer dialog (`F8` / Preferences) with instant sorting controls ("Action (Alphabetical)" vs. "Category").
  - Shortcuts are arranged in clean alphabetical order by action name by default, with one-click toggles and interactive column header sorting.

## v3.1.1-beta-4
- **Contiguous Section Highlight Removal**:
  - Re-engineered `remove_highlight` in `prs_shared.py` to trace linear word sequences across single and multi-paragraph highlighted text blocks.
  - Selecting text or right-clicking anywhere within a highlighted region and choosing "Remove Highlight" now clears background highlighting across the entire contiguous highlighted section spanning multiple sentences or paragraphs.
- **Universal Undo & Redo Integration for Comments and Highlights**:
  - Captured project state baselines before comment deletion, comment creation, comment editing, highlight removal, and highlight toggling.
  - Pushed explicit `ProjectStateCommand` instances to `MainWindow.undo_stack` for every comment and highlight operation.
  - Pressing `Ctrl+Z` (Undo) and `Ctrl+Shift+Z` / `Ctrl+Y` (Redo) now reliably restores or reverts deleted comments and removed highlights.

## v3.1.1-beta-3
- **Bi-Directional Comment & Transcript Selection Synchronization**:
  - Implemented active visual styling for selected comment cards in `CommentsPanel` with high-contrast active borders and background fill.
  - Clicking a comment card in the sidebar highlights the card as active, seeks playback, and selects the corresponding text in the transcript.
  - Clicking or selecting commented text in the transcript view now automatically brings the corresponding comment card into active focus and scrolls it into view.
- **Rich Text Formatting in DOCX Export**:
  - Enhanced DOCX export engine (`create_story_docx` in `export/docx.py`) to reflect word-level and block-level rich text formatting options (**bold**, *italics*, <u>underline</u>, ~strikethrough~, and ==highlighted text==) in exported `.docx` documents.
- **Enhanced Right-Click Context Menu Options**:
  - Added **"Remove Highlight"** option to right-click context menus in both viewing and editing modes to clear highlighting from selected text or targeted segments.
  - Added **"Delete Comment"** option to right-click context menus in both viewing and editing modes to remove the comment and clear any associated highlights.

## v3.1.1-beta-2
- **Range-Based Comment Anchoring & Complete DOCX Export Capture**:
  - Upgraded comment creation (`add_comment_from_selection`) to anchor comments to the full selected text span (e.g. "Back when..." to "...about how") across single or multi-segment selections instead of single words or cursor blocks.
  - Sidebar comment cards and transcript highlights now display and highlight the exact quoted text selection span.
  - Clicking a comment card in the sidebar now seeks to the exact start time and selects the exact highlighted text range in the transcript view.
  - Enhanced DOCX export (`create_story_docx` & `inject_native_comments_to_docx`) to split paragraph runs and anchor OpenXML `w:commentRangeStart` and `w:commentRangeEnd` directly around selected text quotes.
  - Guaranteed 100% complete capture of all comments in transcript exports without omission.
- **Toggle Floating Selection Quick-Action Toolbar Preference**:
  - Added preference setting in Preferences dialog (General -> Selection Popup: "Show floating quick-action toolbar on text selection in transcript") to toggle floating selection tooltips (Play, Story, Comment, Exclude, Export).

## v3.1.1-beta-1
- **Streamlined Click-to-Record Keyboard Shortcut Tools**:
  - Eliminated redundant "Record Key" and "Record Shortcut" buttons from both the Shortcut Lookup Tool and the Shortcut Customizer Editor.
  - Users can now simply click or focus on the shortcut input text box to automatically engage recording mode, significantly streamlining the customizer UX.
- **Unified Export Window & Dialog Initialization Fix**:
  - Restored missing `QStackedWidget` import in `export/dialog.py` to ensure the unified export dialog opens properly without runtime initialization exceptions.
- **Resolved Ambiguous Shortcut Overloads & In-Focus Comment Toggle**:
  - Eliminated duplicate `QAction` shortcut bindings for `Ctrl+Alt+C` across window menus and context menus that previously caused Qt ambiguous shortcut warnings.
  - Replaced duplicate action instances with unified action references and ensured `TranscriptView` key press event routing triggers `toggle_comments_panel()` directly.
  - Re-architected Word `.docx` export pipeline (`create_story_docx` / `export/docx.py`) to package native OOXML annotations (`word/comments.xml`, `w:commentRangeStart`, `w:commentRangeEnd`, and `w:commentReference`) matching Microsoft Word and LibreOffice Writer specification standards.
  - Resolved LibreOffice document corruption warnings by ensuring fully-formed XML namespaces, sequence IDs, and schema references.
  - Exported comments and notes now render as native sidebar comment annotations in both Microsoft Word and LibreOffice Writer (as well as Google Docs).
  - Preserved full author metadata, timestamps, highlighted text ranges, and multi-note threading.
- **Interactive Keyboard Shortcut Lookup Tool & Conflict Inspector**:
  - Added dedicated Shortcut Lookup Tool directly inside the Keyboard Shortcut Customizer (`F8` / Preferences): enter or record any key combination to instantly see which function is currently mapped to it.
  - Displays rich metadata (action name, category, description, custom vs default status, and availability state).
  - Included interactive "📍 Select in Table" one-click jump to highlight and focus the matching action in the customizer table.
- **Transcript Text Selection Preservation**:
  - Fixed selection loss during text formatting: invoking Bold (`Ctrl+B`), Italic (`Ctrl+I`), Underline (`Ctrl+U`), Strikethrough (`Ctrl+K`), Highlighter, or Clear Formatting (`Ctrl+\`) now preserves the active text selection range until the user clicks elsewhere in the transcript.
- **Multi-Color Highlighter Palette & HTML Rendering**:
  - Restored highlighter functionality with support for 6 vibrant, standard highlighting colors: Yellow (`#fef08a`), Green (`#bbf7d0`), Cyan/Blue (`#bae6fd`), Pink (`#fbcfe8`), Orange (`#fed7aa`), and Purple (`#e9d5ff`).
  - Added color dropdown menu to the Highlight toolbar button and right-click context menu, with full token persistence and dynamic HTML styling.
- **Harmonized Keyboard Shortcut Engine & In-Focus Window Overrides**:
  - Enforced `Qt.ShortcutContext.ApplicationShortcut` across actions so in-focus application events execute reliably without OS collisions.
  - Set default keyboard shortcut for toggling the Comments Sidebar & Annotations to `Ctrl+Alt+C` (macOS: `Cmd+Option+C`).
  - Added full shortcut bindings and customization support for Rich Text Formatting (**Highlight**: `Ctrl+Shift+H`, **Bold**: `Ctrl+B`, **Italic**: `Ctrl+I`, **Underline**: `Ctrl+U`, **Strikethrough**: `Ctrl+K`, **Clear Formatting**: `Ctrl+\`) and **Split Speaker Segment** (`Shift+Enter`).
  - Enhanced Shortcut Customizer with automatic recording lifecycle and conflict resolution dialog.
- **Dynamic Toolbar Tooltips with Live Keyboard Shortcuts**:
  - All toolbar buttons (Comments toggle, Transcript Edit Mode toggle, Font size increase/decrease/reset, Bold, Italic, Underline, Strikethrough, Highlight, Clear Formatting, Split Speaker, Play/Pause, and Story controls) dynamically reflect their current assigned keyboard shortcuts directly in hover tooltips.

## v3.1.0-dev-2
- **Universal .docx Comments Compatibility (Microsoft Word, LibreOffice, Google Docs)**:
  - Re-engineered the Word (.docx) document export engine to generate both native OpenXML comments (`word/comments.xml`, `w:commentRangeStart`, `w:commentRangeEnd`, and `w:commentReference`) and styled visual annotation callouts.
  - Exported comments now appear in Microsoft Word's comment review pane, LibreOffice Writer's comment margin cards, and when uploaded to Google Docs.
  - Includes user preference integration (`export_include_comments`) with full timestamp spans, speaker attribution, and author metadata.
- **Keyboard Shortcut Customizer & Conflict Resolution System**:
  - Integrated interactive conflict detection in the Keyboard Shortcut Customizer (`F8` / Preferences): when assigning a key combination already in use by another action, a warning dialog prompts the user to either apply the shortcut to the new action (reassigning it) or keep the original binding.
  - If keeping the original binding, the customizer automatically re-engages recording mode so the user can immediately enter an alternative shortcut combination.
  - Added new actions to the shortcut registry: **Add / Edit Comment** (`Ctrl+M`), **Toggle Comments Sidebar** (`Alt+5`), **Toggle Transcript Edit Mode** (`F2`), **Bold** (`Ctrl+B`), **Italic** (`Ctrl+I`), **Underline** (`Ctrl+U`), **Strikethrough** (`Ctrl+K`), and **Clear Formatting** (`Ctrl+\`).
  - Resolved shortcut collisions across the application (e.g., separating Batch Processing to `Ctrl+Shift+B` so `Ctrl+B` is dedicated to Bold text formatting).
  - Enforced window-scoped shortcut context (`Qt.ShortcutContext.WindowShortcut`) across all actions so in-focus application events execute reliably.
- **Plugin Export Destination Architecture & WordPress Publishing Fix**:
  - Resolved plugin interface contracts in `export/dialog.py` and `plugins/wordpress/export_destination.py`, ensuring all plugin destinations supply appropriate button labels, icons, and configuration panels.
- **Codebase Modularization & Decoupled Architecture**:
  - Decoupled domain-specific export engines out of monolithic scripts into a dedicated `export/` package (`export/pdf.py`, `export/docx.py`, `export/subtitles.py`, `export/dialog.py`).
  - Implemented true dynamic plugin export destination architecture via `plugins.base.ExportDestination` and `PluginManager`.
  - Created structured data model layer (`models.py`) with type-annotated dataclasses (`StoryItem`, `ActivitySnapshot`, `ExportOptions`) and TypedDict definitions.
  - Extracted core utilities and dialog components into `utils/` (`constants.py`, `time_format.py`) and `ui/dialogs/` (`find_replace.py`, `comment_editor.py`).

## v3.0.2
- **Native PDF Document Export**:
  - Implemented standalone `TranscriptPdfWriter` generating native, dependency-free PDF 1.4 vector documents for individual story transcripts and full episode transcripts.
  - Added PDF format checkbox (`PDF document (.pdf)`) to Local Export formats alongside Text (.txt) and Word DOCX (.docx).
  - High-precision typography layout with Helvetica, Helvetica-Bold, and Helvetica-Oblique font resources, headers, metadata ribbons, line dividers, word-wrapped body paragraphs, timestamps, and speaker labels.
  - Professional comment callouts in PDF exports with yellow/amber side borders, distinctive backgrounds, and indented typography.
  - Automatic multi-page pagination with running page headers, dividers, and document footers ("Page X" and "Radio & TV Story Segmenter").
  - Export settings persistence (`export_format_pdf`) via `QSettings` and multi-format batch validation.
- **Collapsible Export Center Sections**:
  - Re-architected `UnifiedExportDialog` with reusable `CollapsibleSection` container widgets featuring animated disclosure chevrons, count badges, and clean rounded panels.
  - Organized Local Files, WordPress, and YouTube Studio export panels into clean, individually expandable and collapsible sections to optimize window height and visibility.
  - Added global "Collapse All / Expand All" toggle button to the main export header for one-click workflow navigation.

## v3.0.1-beta-1
- **Transcript Rich Text Formatting Toolbar & Styling Engine**:
  - Added dedicated formatting toolbar above the transcript view that automatically appears when Editing Mode is toggled on (`Edit Transcript`).
  - Added quick-access formatting buttons: **Bold** (`Ctrl+B`), **Italic** (`Ctrl+I`), **Underline** (`Ctrl+U`), **Strikethrough** (`Ctrl+K`), **Highlight** (Yellow text background), **Clear Formatting** (`Ctrl+\` / `Ctrl+Space`), and **Split Speaker Segment** (`Shift+Enter`).
  - Implemented real-time bidirectional format detection: toolbar buttons automatically toggle their active/pressed state matching the styling of text at the current cursor position or selection (`formatChanged` signal & cursor tracking).
  - Added right-click context menu "Format Text" submenu in editing mode providing full access to all styling actions and hotkeys.
  - Non-destructive token synchronization: word-level styling (`bold`, `italic`, `underline`, `strike`, `highlight`) is preserved across token splicing, re-rendering, and translation views.
- **Multi-Location Comments Sidebar Toggles**:
  - Added checkable "Show Comments Sidebar" option (`Ctrl+Alt+M`) to the **View > Transcript** submenu.
  - Retained "Show Comments Sidebar & Highlights" in top-level **View** menu and the "💬 Comments" toggle button in the transcript search header bar.
  - Connected the sidebar's close (`✕`) button directly to synchronized toggle state so closing the panel updates the toolbar button and all menu checkboxes synchronously.
  - Maintained user preference persistence for sidebar visibility across application sessions.

## v3.0.0-beta.5
- **Word / Google Docs / LibreOffice Style Comments Architecture**:
  - Re-architected notes into a professional, non-destructive **Comments** system inspired by Microsoft Word, Google Docs, and LibreOffice Writer.
  - Removed raw inline note blocks from the transcript body, keeping the reading flow completely uncluttered.
  - Implemented collapsible, docked **Comments Sidebar** (`CommentsPanel`) with comment cards displaying timestamp spans, quote excerpt anchors, multi-line comment text, and quick ✏️ Edit and 🗑️ Delete/Resolve actions.
  - Two-way interactive synchronization: clicking a comment card scrolls the transcript to the passage and seeks audio playback; hovering or clicking commented transcript passages highlights and scrolls to the card in the sidebar.
  - Non-destructive amber/yellow highlight ranges (`#fef08a` / `#854d0e`) rendered over commented transcript text via `QTextEdit.ExtraSelection` with hover tooltips.
  - Added dedicated View menu action "Show Comments Sidebar & Highlights" (`Ctrl+Alt+M`) and search bar toggle button.
- **Spacebar & Dialog Focus Isolation**:
  - Isolated keyboard shortcut dispatching (`eventFilter`) so global Play/Pause hotkeys are strictly suppressed whenever a text input, dialog, or comment editor is active.
  - Multi-line `CommentEditorDialog` with full native support for spaces, tabs, line breaks (`Enter`), and quick save (`Ctrl+Enter`).
- **Transcript Paragraph-Constrained Navigation**:
  - Fixed `Home` and `End` keys in `InteractiveTranscriptEdit` to seek and navigate strictly within the current paragraph block rather than jumping across the entire document.
  - Arrow key navigation in viewing mode jumps playback according to user skip settings and synchronizes timeline cursor and transcript word highlighting.
- **Decommissioned Project & Episode Notes (Scope Simplification)**:
  - Completely removed legacy project and episode notes dialogs and menus, focusing exclusively on segment-anchored document comments.
- **Word Document (DOCX) Comments Export**:
  - Added an "Include Comments" option to the export settings dialog with preference persistence.
  - Exports segment-anchored comments into Microsoft Word documents as beautifully styled, indented callouts (`💬 Comment: ...`) with accurate timing and speaker context.

## v3.0.0-beta.4
- **Transcript Navigation & Selection Jumping**:
  - Implemented timestamp and speaker label cursor navigation: clicking any timestamp link `[00:00]` or speaker header in `InteractiveTranscriptEdit` seeks playback to that exact second and positions text cursor precisely at the clicked location.
  - Paragraph-scoped `Home` and `End` key navigation moving the text cursor strictly to the start or end of the current paragraph block rather than jumping across the full transcript document.
  - Arrow key skipping in transcript edit view synchronized with user playback skip preferences (`playback_skip_interval`).
- **Interactive Notes & Highlighting System**:
  - Multi-line text note input supporting spaces, tabs, and paragraph breaks via custom `NoteInputDialog`.
  - Rich document-style section highlighting: text selections assigned notes are highlighted in distinct amber/yellow background styling (`#fef08a` / `#854d0e`), separate from active selection highlights.
  - Hover tooltip badges and right-click context menu options to view, edit, or delete notes attached to transcript segments.
  - "Add Note" trigger integrated into floating selection bubble and context menu.
- **DOCX Export with Notes**:
  - Updated `UnifiedExportDialog` and `project_export.py` with an "Include Segment & Project Notes" toggle (`export_opt_include_notes`).
  - Native Word document export renders formatted note paragraphs with custom indented callouts and distinct styling.

## v3.0.0-beta.3
- **Single-Instance Application Enforcement & Preference**:
  - Added preference setting in `playback_preferences.py` ("Instance Handling Mode") allowing users to choose between single-instance mode and multi-instance mode.
  - Implemented cross-instance IPC via `QLocalServer` and `QLocalSocket` in `RadioTVSegmenter.py`. When double-clicking an `.rtvs` file while the app is already running in single-instance mode, the file path is forwarded to the existing process.
  - If another project is open with unsaved changes, the app prompts the user to save before loading the requested project or dismiss the request.
- **Media Ingest Prompt Mode**:
  - Fixed prompt behavior when Media Ingest Mode is set to `"Prompt every time when saving project"` (`media_ingest_mode: ask`).
  - Triggers an interactive `QMessageBox` during `save_project` asking if the source media file should be copied into the project bundle `Media/` subfolder.
- **Project-Local Peak Cache Storage**:
  - Pre-calculated waveform `.peaks` cache files are now stored inside the project folder's hidden `.cache/peaks/` subfolder (or alongside the `.rtvs` file) rather than polluting the source media directory.
- **Transcript Keyboard Navigation**:
  - Enabled Home, End, PageUp, PageDown, and Arrow key navigation in `InteractiveTranscriptEdit` during viewing mode to move through transcript text smoothly.
- **Clickable Speaker & Timestamp Links**:
  - Enabled clicking on speaker labels (`speaker:`) and timestamps in the transcript to instantly seek timeline, audio, and video preview to that exact moment.
- **Transcript Notes & Segment Notes System**:
  - Added context menu actions ("Edit Segment Note..." and "Transcript & Project Notes...") to `InteractiveTranscriptEdit`.
  - In-line segment notes are rendered with yellow callout badges in the transcript viewer and saved directly in `.rtvs` project files.
  - Full project/episode notes and segment notes are automatically styled and included in DOCX exports.
- **Cache Usage & Purge Discovery**:
  - Fixed cache scanner in `get_cache_disk_usage` and `purge_caches` by automatically discovering project paths via `QSettings` (`default_project_directory`, `last_saved_project_path`, `recent_projects`), accurately calculating total `.peaks` files and bytes.
- **UI Contrast & Layout Fixes**:
  - Enhanced contrast for story list items in dark mode.
  - Consolidated Quick Actions bubble layout preventing label truncation.

## v3.0.0-beta
- **Debian / Ubuntu (.deb) Control Version Compliance**:
  - Fixed an issue where Debian control files generated with `V3.0.0-beta` or uppercase/prefixed version strings failed `dpkg-deb` validation (`'Version' field value: version number does not start with digit`).
  - Added Debian-compliant version string sanitization (`DEB_VERSION`) in `installer/Linux/build_deb.sh`, ensuring version strings strictly begin with digits, convert uppercase tags to lowercase, and map hyphens to tildes (`~`).
  - Sanitized version extraction across all GitHub Actions workflow jobs in `.github/workflows/build.yml`.
- **Self-Contained Project Bundles & Ingest Preferences**:
  - Added project media ingest behavior preferences (Reference in place vs. Copy into project bundle vs. Ask when saving) in `playback_preferences.py` and `project_export.py`.
  - Added automated disk space preflight verification before media ingestion using `shutil.disk_usage`, prompting confirmation when source media is large (>1 GB) or low disk headroom (<10%) is detected.
- **Clean Dedicated Directory Hierarchy**:
  - Upgraded project bundle structure to dedicated subfolders: `<Project>/media/` (original recordings), `<Project>/exports/audio/` (cut audio files), `<Project>/exports/transcripts/` (transcripts and documents), and `<Project>/.cache/` (hidden peak and transient caches).
  - Maintained complete backward compatibility for legacy projects with multi-tier fallback resolution in `resolve_project_media()`.
- **Project Maintenance & Mobility Tools**:
  - Added **File > Consolidate Media into Project...** to easily copy external files into the project directory for portability.
  - Added **File > Clean Cache / Reclaim Space...** to inspect and prune `.cache/peaks/` and scratch buffers.
  - Added **File > Export Project Archive (.zip)...** with customizable inclusion of source media, transcripts, and exports while excluding temporary caches.
  - Added interactive **Locate Missing Media** dialog with auto-discovery and one-click re-linking.
- **Workflow & UI Polish**:
  - Added interactive drag-and-drop zero-state onboarding cards to `InteractiveTranscriptEdit` and `StoryListWidget`.
  - Added "Open Folder" action button on export completion dialogs (`show_export_completion_dialog`) across story exports, full episodes, CUE sheets, and tracklists.
  - Added floating quick-action selection bubble toolbar (`TranscriptSelectionBubble`) over transcript selections with instant Play, + Story, Exclude, and Quick Export buttons.
  - Added dual-layer timeline navigation (`TimelineWidget`) with interactive macro overview strip, story segment blocks, and draggable viewfinder rectangle.
  - Added harmonized color-coded story accents across story cards (`StoryCardDelegate`), timeline spans, and transcript markers.
- **Full Project Version Alignment**:
  - Synchronized `v3.0.0-beta` across `prs_shared.py`, `updater.py`, `build_installer.py`, `RadioTVStorySegmenter.iss`, `package.json`, `metadata.json`, `index.html`, `transcript_story.py`, and plugin manifests (`wordpress`, `youtube`, `translation`).

## v2.9.6
- **Windows & Cross-Platform Artifact Naming Normalization**:
  - Resolved an issue in the packaging pipeline where double dots (e.g. `2.9..6`) could be introduced into Windows installer executable names (`RadioTVSegmenter-2.9.6-Windows-Setup.exe`) and Linux tarball archives.
  - Hardened version extraction in `build_installer.py`, `build_windows.bat`, `build_deb.sh`, `build_app.sh`, and `.github/workflows/build.yml` with strict dot-collapsing and semantic versioning sanitization (`re.sub(r"\.+", ".", v)` / `tr -s '.'`).
- **Updater Engine Resilient Asset Matching & Semantic Verification**:
  - Enhanced `updater.py` with normalized string and semantic comparison logic across `parse_version_tuple`, `_find_release_checksum`, `select_best_asset_for_platform`, and `_display_release`.
  - Checksum discovery and asset matching now seamlessly handle normalized filenames (collapsing any legacy double-dot naming), ensuring download and verification never fail due to minor formatting discrepancies.
  - Asset label mismatch notices now evaluate numerical semantic version tuples rather than raw string comparisons to eliminate false-alarm warning banners.
- **Full Project Version Alignment**:
  - Synchronized `v2.9.6` across `prs_shared.py`, `updater.py`, `build_installer.py`, `RadioTVStorySegmenter.iss`, `package.json`, `metadata.json`, `index.html`, `transcript_story.py`, and plugin manifests (`wordpress`, `youtube`, `translation`).
- **AI Studio Web Preview Git Hygiene & Zero-Token Scaffolding Restoration**:
  - Consolidated and restructured `.gitignore` to strictly isolate all Node/Vite web preview files (`package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `vite.config.ts`, `tailwind.config.js`, `postcss.config.js`, `eslint.config.js`, `metadata.json`, `index.html`, `src/`, `public/`, `node_modules/`, `bun.lock`), keeping the GitHub repository focused exclusively on the Python desktop application.
  - Removed stale untracked `gitignore` file (without leading dot) to restore canonical gitignore parsing.
  - Implemented `preview_manager.py` to enable instant zero-token restoration and version synchronization across all web preview files (`python preview_manager.py --restore` / `--sync`).
  - Decoupled `src/App.tsx` from manual markdown copy-pasting by importing `CHANGELOG.md?raw` directly, ensuring real-time changelog preview updates without code maintenance overhead.

## v2.9.5
- **WordPress Export Media Notice Placement**:
  - Refined custom notice placement in `wordpress_export.py` so that top-positioned header notices appear directly beneath embedded audio (`<!-- wp:audio -->`) or video (`<!-- wp:video -->`) players, ensuring media player controls stay prominently at the top of the post.
- **Updater Engine Semantic Comparison Fix**:
  - Resolved an issue in `updater.py` where `is_version_older` was not defined when `_on_releases_loaded` was triggered by background release queries.
  - Implemented `is_version_older(remote_version_str, current_version_str)` for accurate semantic version tuple evaluation.
  - Restored full interactive visibility of the historical release selector dropdown (`QComboBox`) in the "Check for Updates" dialog.
- **Full Project Version Alignment**:
  - Synchronized `v2.9.5` across `prs_shared.py`, `updater.py`, `build_installer.py`, `RadioTVStorySegmenter.iss`, `package.json`, `metadata.json`, `index.html`, `transcript_story.py`, and plugin manifests (`wordpress`, `youtube`, `translation`).
  - Added the incremental point release policy to project instructions (`AGENTS.md` and `GEMINI.md`).

## v2.9.4
- **Version Rollback & Historical Release Selector (Updater Engine)**:
  - Upgraded the "Check for Updates" dialog (`updater.py`) with an interactive historical release selector dropdown (`QComboBox`).
  - Fetches and displays all available GitHub releases with real-time release notes rendering in `QTextBrowser` upon selecting any past or current version.
  - Dynamically updates action button context and labels: "Update to v...", "Reinstall v...", or "Rollback to v...".
  - Implemented a safety warning modal confirmation dialog (`_confirm_downgrade`) when selecting an older version than currently installed to protect against configuration and project data incompatibilities.
- **Full Project Version Alignment**:
  - Synchronized `v2.9.4` across `prs_shared.py`, `updater.py`, `build_installer.py`, `RadioTVStorySegmenter.iss`, `package.json`, `metadata.json`, `index.html`, `transcript_story.py`, and plugin manifests (`wordpress`, `youtube`, `translation`).

## v2.9.3
- **CI/CD Version Tag Synchronization**:
  - Fixed workflow release packaging to dynamically extract the release version from git tags (`GITHUB_REF_NAME`) or manual workflow inputs rather than falling back to stale local files.
  - Injected `BUILD_VERSION` into all platform build jobs (`build-plugins`, `build-windows`, `build-macos`, `build-linux`) in `.github/workflows/build.yml`.
- **Dynamic Build System Overrides**:

- **Version Alignment**:
  - Updated application version, installer scripts, plugin manifests, and documentation to v2.8.3.

## v2.8.2
- **Isolated Runtime Mount Point & Link Mode Resilience**:
  - Resolved `[TRANSLATION ERROR] Failed to create Python minor version link directory (os error 448: The path cannot be traversed because it contains an untrusted mount point)` during translation runtime and OPUS-MT model installation on Windows.
  - Enforced `UV_LINK_MODE="copy"`, `UV_CACHE_DIR`, and `UV_DATA_DIR` across all `uv` environment creation (`uv venv --link-mode copy`) and package installation (`uv pip install --link-mode copy`) steps, preventing junction and symlink traversal failures on redirected or OneDrive-synced user directories.
  - Added self-healing runtime discovery (`_find_extracted_python`) in `RuntimeManager` that detects and verifies extracted Python interpreters even if post-install junction links report mount-point errors.
  - Added direct standalone CPython 3.12 download and pure archive extraction fallback (`python-build-standalone`) when junction-based package management is blocked by OS security policies.
  - Upgraded standalone `uv` toolchain version to `0.12.12`.
- **Version Alignment**:
  - Updated application version, installer scripts, and plugin manifests to v2.8.2.

  - Implemented real-time chunked streaming downloads for Whisper and Parakeet models in `WhisperModelInstallWorker`, replacing stalled opaque downloads with live byte/MB counters and percentage tracking.
  - Resolved frozen-process `NoneType.write` crashes on clean Windows installs by introducing `NullWriter` stream guards and disabling terminal progress bars (`tqdm`, `huggingface_hub`) in GUI environments.
  - Removed deprecated `resume_download` and `local_dir_use_symlinks` parameters to eliminate modern `huggingface_hub` UserWarnings.
  - Hardened file finalization with atomic `os.replace` operations across temporary `.download` artifacts to prevent Windows file-sharing errors.
  - Added non-zero integrity checks (`stat().st_size > 1024`) in model availability verification to prevent interrupted 0-byte files from being identified as valid installations.
- **Translation Staging & Add-on Delivery**:
  - Added multi-file HTTP streaming fallback for all standard OPUS-MT assets (`config.json`, tokenizers, `source.spm`, `model.safetensors`, and `pytorch_model.bin`).
- **Tools Menu Accessibility**:
  - Added direct **Tools > Manage AI Models...** menu entry alongside existing Preferences navigation.
- **Version Alignment**:
  - Updated application, installer scripts, and plugin manifests to v2.8.1.

## v2.8.0
- Updated application and plugin versions to v2.8 across core, installers, and manifests.
- **Decoupled Translation Worker from PySide6**: Isolated translation runtime no longer requires or installs PySide6. Implemented a pure-Python `Signal` descriptor and `QObject` fallback in `worker.py` and guarded `QCoreApplication` in `runtime_entry.py`.
- **Dynamic Plugin Runtime Requirements**: `RuntimeManager` now dynamically reads `requirements-runtime.txt` from plugin directories rather than relying strictly on static configuration.
- **CPU PyTorch Wheel Configuration**: Isolated translation environment utilizes `--extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu` to avoid multi-gigabyte CUDA wheel downloads on CPU-only machines.
- **Cross-Platform `uv` Provisioning**: Added standalone `uv` binaries for Windows (x86_64, arm64), macOS (x86_64, arm64), and Linux (x86_64, aarch64) in `build_installer.py`, enabling automated managed Python provisioning across all platforms.
- **Enhanced Diagnostic Reporting**: Added detailed subprocess error capture in `RuntimeManager` and surfaced detailed error diagnostics in the translation UI.
- **Synchronized Plugin Add-on Archives**: Updated and re-packaged `.rtvs-addon` packages (`translation`, `wordpress`, `youtube`) and enhanced `PluginManager.ensure_packaged_addons()` to auto-refresh outdated archives when plugin source manifests change.

## v2.76c
- Reworked the plugin architecture around explicit core/shared versus isolated runtimes.
- Moved the OPUS-MT translation worker implementation out of the core application.
- Translation now runs through the plugin-owned isolated Python runtime.
- Removed translation-only `transformers`, `sentencepiece`, and `sacremoses` dependencies from the core Python requirements and core PyInstaller collection.
- Added `plugins/translation/requirements-runtime.txt` and isolated runtime metadata.
- Translation models are owned by the translation plugin's model registry and are hidden from Manage Models when the plugin is uninstalled.
- Uninstalling the translation plugin removes its isolated runtime but deliberately preserves downloaded translation models.
- Fixed Preferences category navigation so aliases such as `Models`, `AI Models`, `Detection`, and `Batch` select the correct page.
- WordPress and YouTube remain lightweight core-runtime plugins and use the same manifest architecture.
- Updated release version references to 2.76c.


## v2.7.1

### Disk Cache Management & "Clear Temporary Cache" Dialog
- **Temporary Cache Manager Dialog (`ClearCacheDialog`)**: Added a user-facing temporary cache inspection and cleanup dialog accessible via **Tools > Clear Temporary Cache...** and **Settings > Clear Temporary Cache...**.
- **Per-Store Disk Usage Breakdown**: Computes real-time file counts and storage size across:
  - **Video Thumbnails & Filmstrips**: Cached timeline thumbnail images in `%TEMP%/radio_tv_story_segmenter_thumbnails/`.
  - **Audio Waveform Peaks**: Precomputed waveform envelopes (`.peaks`) in `%APPDATA%/RadioTVStorySegmenter/cache/peaks/`.
  - **Temporary Audio Workfiles**: Temporary extracted audio tracks and work buffers (`prs_tmp_*.wav`, `rtvs_tmp_*.wav`).
- **Selective & Full Purging**: Users can selectively clear specific stores or click the primary **Clear All Caches** button to immediately reclaim all temporary disk space.
- **Bilingual Localization Support**: Full English and Spanish translation support for all cache dialog labels, feedback prompts, and menu actions.

### Build Pipeline Transparency & Real-Time Logging
- **Live Output Streaming**: Refactored `build_installer.py` subprocess runner to use unbuffered line-by-line live streaming via `subprocess.Popen(stdout=subprocess.PIPE, bufsize=1)`, eliminating log buffering delays in GitHub Actions CI runners.
- **Unbuffered Python Environment**: Configured `PYTHONUNBUFFERED: "1"` in `.github/workflows/build.yml` to ensure continuous stdout flushing across Windows, Linux, and macOS runners.
- **Stage Progress Banners**: Added explicit progress headers (`[1/5]` through `[5/5]`) and `--log-level INFO` verbosity to PyInstaller build steps, ensuring clear visibility into binary compilation stages.

### Ecosystem Version Alignment
- **Global v2.7.1 Synchronization**: Synchronized application, installer, and plugin versions across `prs_shared.py`, `package.json`, `RadioTVSegmenter.py`, `transcript_story.py`, `updater.py`, `build_installer.py`, `installer/Windows/RadioTVStorySegmenter.iss`, `build_windows.bat`, `build_linux.sh`, `installer/Linux/build_deb.sh`, `installer/macOS/build_app.sh`, `.github/workflows/build.yml`, and all plugin manifests (`plugins/wordpress/manifest.json`, `plugins/youtube/manifest.json`, `plugins/translation/manifest.json`).

## v2.7.0

### Video Thumbnail Caching & Instant Project Reloading
- **Persistent Disk Thumbnail Caching**: Added deterministic, media-hash-keyed thumbnail disk caching (`get_video_thumbnail_cache_dir`, `read_video_thumbnail_cache`, `invalidate_video_thumbnail_cache`) in `prs_shared.py`.
- **Instant Project Restoration**: Opening a video file or reloading an existing `.rtvs` project now instantly reads cached filmstrip thumbnails directly from disk without re-extracting frames via FFmpeg.
- **Immediate Generation Preview & Track Placeholder**: Restored immediate visual feedback during thumbnail extraction, rendering a filmstrip track placeholder along with centered "Generating video thumbnails..." preview text and status banner.
- **Cache Invalidation & Manual Refresh**: Thumbnail cache automatically validates file modification timestamps (`st_mtime`) against the source video, ensuring stale frames are evicted if media is modified. Manual regeneration (**Media > Regenerate Video Thumbnails**) clears cache and re-extracts cleanly.
- **Extended Cache Retention**: Extended default background cache retention (`cleanup_old_thumbnail_cache`) from 24 hours to 7 days (168 hours) to ensure work-in-progress desktop video projects retain cached filmstrips across sessions.

### GitHub Actions Workflow Optimizations
- **All-Build Defaults**: Updated the GitHub Actions release workflow (`.github/workflows/build.yml`) `workflow_dispatch` configuration so all build checkboxes (`build_windows`, `build_macos`, `build_linux`, `plugin_wordpress`, `plugin_youtube`, `plugin_translation`, `create_release`) default to `true` (`checked`), allowing release managers to deselect targets rather than checking each one manually.

### Ecosystem Version Alignment
- **Global v2.7.0 Synchronization**: Bumped project and plugin versions to `2.7.0` across `prs_shared.py`, `package.json`, `RadioTVSegmenter.py`, `transcript_story.py`, `updater.py`, `build_installer.py`, `installer/Windows/RadioTVStorySegmenter.iss`, `build_windows.bat`, `build_linux.sh`, `installer/Linux/build_deb.sh`, `installer/macOS/build_app.sh`, `.github/workflows/build.yml`, and all plugin manifests (`plugins/wordpress/manifest.json`, `plugins/youtube/manifest.json`, `plugins/translation/manifest.json`).

## v2.6.5

### In-Dialog Video Frame Scrubber & Thumbnail Controls
- **Interactive In-Dialog Timeline Scrubber**: Added an interactive horizontal slider, precision step buttons (`◀ -1s`, `◀ -1f`, `+1f ▶`, `+1s ▶`), live timestamp readout (`hh:mm:ss.zzz`), and a `⟳ Playhead` synchronization button directly inside both WordPress and YouTube export panels in `UnifiedExportDialog`.
- **Debounced Frame Previews**: Enabled responsive thumbnail capture with a 120ms debounce timer for smooth in-dialog scrubbing without freezing the UI.
- **Audio-Only Project Protection**: Automatically detects audio-only projects and disables "Grab frame from video" with helpful guidance tooltips, defaulting gracefully to "None", "Automatic", or custom image browse modes.

### Process Hardening & Temporary Asset Cleanup
- **FFmpeg Subprocess Timeouts**: Added 5-second timeouts and `TimeoutExpired` exception handling to all FFmpeg thumbnail extraction calls in `project_export.py`, preventing freezes on corrupted or unresponsive media.
- **Temporary Preview File Lifecycle**: Added automated tracking and purging of temporary preview files (`rtvs_wp_frame_*.jpg`, `rtvs_yt_frame_*.jpg`) on dialog cancellation or closure.

### Timeline Thumbnail Density Optimization
- **Increased Frame Extraction Density**: Increased `VideoThumbnailWorker` extraction count ceiling from 48 to 80 frames for richer visual coverage across long media files.
- **Aspect-Ratio-Preserving Density Tuning**: Optimized timeline thumbnail rendering dimensions with reduced horizontal scaling minimums and a 2.0px minimum gap, displaying more visual frames simultaneously without cropping images.

### Version Synchronization
- **Ecosystem Version Alignment**: Bumped project and plugin versions to `2.6.5` across `prs_shared.py`, `package.json`, `RadioTVSegmenter.py`, `transcript_story.py`, `updater.py`, `build_installer.py`, `installer/Windows/RadioTVStorySegmenter.iss`, `plugins/wordpress/manifest.json`, `plugins/youtube/manifest.json`, and `plugins/translation/manifest.json`.

## v2.6.0

### Modular Plugin System
- **Plugin Management Engine**: Introduced modular plugin architecture (`plugins/manager.py`) with `BasePlugin`, `PluginManifest`, and `PluginManager` supporting auto-discovery, lifecycle controls, and dynamic loading from both bundled and user-level plugin directories.
- **WordPress Publisher Plugin**: Migrated WordPress publishing capabilities into a modular add-on (`plugins/wordpress/`) with category/tag syncing, excerpt formatting, featured image uploads, and background worker threads.
- **YouTube Video Publisher Plugin**: Implemented dedicated YouTube publisher plugin (`plugins/youtube/`) featuring OAuth 2.0 PKCE authentication with local callback server, chunked resumable video uploads, metadata/tag management, video frame thumbnail capture, and privacy settings.
- **Language Translation Plugin**: Encapsulated local neural machine translation into a modular add-on (`plugins/translation/`) with MarianMT and NLLB models and bilingual split-view editing.
- **Dynamic UI Menus**: Added dynamic action populator for `File -> Publishing & Plugins` and dynamic tool entries under `Tools`, plus the `Tools -> Manage Plugins & Add-ons...` management dialog.

### Project Storage & Backward Compatibility
- **Forward & Backward Compatibility**: Enhanced `.rtvs` project serialization and `Story` models with extensible `metadata` and top-level `plugins_data` dictionaries. Projects created in v2.6.0 open seamlessly in v2.5.2 without parsing errors, and legacy projects open in v2.6.0 without data loss.

### CI/CD Workflow & Selective Build Matrix
- **Selective Plugin Packaging & Building**: Extended `build_installer.py` and GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/build.yml`) with build target options (`Core App + Selected Plugins`, `Core App Only`, and `Plugins Only`) and individual plugin checkboxes (`plugin_wordpress`, `plugin_youtube`, `plugin_translation`).
- **Standalone Release Artifacts**: Generated standalone `.zip` packages for each plugin (`rtvs-plugin-<id>-v2.6.0.zip`) ready for direct release distribution or in-app installation.
- **Version Bump**: Bumped version to `2.6.0` across `prs_shared.py`, `RadioTVSegmenter.py`, `media_batch.py`, `playback_preferences.py`, `updater.py`, `build_installer.py`, `build_windows.bat`, `build_linux.sh`, `installer/Windows/RadioTVStorySegmenter.iss`, `installer/Linux/build_deb.sh`, `installer/macOS/build_app.sh`, `.github/workflows/build.yml`, `package.json`, and all plugin manifests.

## v2.5.2

### Timeline Video Thumbnails Layout & Vertical Resizing
- **Thumbnails Positioned Below Waveform**: Relocated the video thumbnail track in `TimelineCanvas` so that thumbnails render cleanly beneath the audio waveform rather than above or overlaying it.
- **Dynamic Vertical Resizing**: Replaced the static thumbnail scaling constraints with dynamic aspect-ratio-aware dimensions that automatically expand and contract proportionally as the user resizes the timeline widget vertically.
- **Track Separation**: Added a subtle boundary divider between the audio waveform and video thumbnail strips for clear visual segmentation.
- **Higher Resolution Thumbnails**: Increased thumbnail extraction scale to 320px width (`scale=320:-2`) to keep video frames sharp and clear on high-DPI displays and enlarged timeline heights.
- **Preferences Configuration**: Added a "Thumbnail Placement" option under Preferences (Playback & Timeline) allowing users to choose between "Below audio waveform" (default) or "Above audio waveform".

### Automated Windows Installer & Version Synchronization
- **Strict Version Synchronization**: Updated `build_installer.py` with `sync_installer_scripts()` to automatically rewrite and verify the `#define MyAppVersion` directive in `installer/Windows/RadioTVStorySegmenter.iss` from the project's single source of truth (`PROJECT_VERSION` in `prs_shared.py`).
- **Direct Inno Setup Compilation Support**: Integrated automated detection and invocation of `ISCC.exe` into `build_installer.py`, compiling the Windows installer executable with `/DMyAppVersion="{PROJECT_VERSION}"` without relying on manual command-line flags.
- **Resilient Batch Extraction**: Hardened `build_windows.bat` to detect and use the active `!PYTHON_EXE!` runtime with regex extraction directly from `prs_shared.py`, preventing fallback issues when executing the Inno Setup compiler.
- **Version Bump**: Bumped version to `2.5.2` across `prs_shared.py`, `RadioTVSegmenter.py`, `media_batch.py`, `playback_preferences.py`, `updater.py`, `build_installer.py`, `build_windows.bat`, `build_linux.sh`, `installer/Windows/RadioTVStorySegmenter.iss`, `installer/Linux/build_deb.sh`, `installer/macOS/build_app.sh`, and `.github/workflows/build.yml`.

## v2.5.1

### Version Bump & Maintenance
- **Version Alignment**: Bumped project version to `2.5.1` across core modules, packaging scripts, and CI workflows.

## v2.4.2

### Timeline Interaction & Boundary Protection
- **Protected Timeline Boundary Handles**: Disabled accidental boundary modifications caused by left-clicking and dragging story edge handles in the timeline. Left-clicks across the timeline now exclusively handle playback seeking and audio scrubbing.
- **Explicit Right-Click & Button Boundary Adjustments**: Timeline boundary adjustments now require deliberate user actions:
  - Right-clicking and dragging a story's boundary handle directly resizes that boundary with undo/redo snapshotting.
  - Right-clicking and dragging across any timeline segment creates a selection region that can be quickly assigned with "Set Story Start" or "Set Story End".
  - Hovering over a story boundary handle displays an informative tooltip (`Right-click and drag to adjust`).
- **Version Synchronization**: Bumped version to `2.4.2` across `prs_shared.py`, `RadioTVSegmenter.py`, `build_installer.py`, `updater.py`, `package.json`, Windows Inno Setup, Linux Debian packaging, macOS bundling, and GitHub Actions CI workflows.

## v2.4.1

### Features & Story Boundary Controls
- **Set Story Start & End Buttons**: Restored dedicated "Set Story Start" and "Set Story End" action buttons in the Stories & Segments widget.
- **Contextual Timestamp Snapping**: Pressing either button sets the story's start or end boundary to match the current interaction position across the transcript and timeline:
  - Active timeline drag selections and highlighted transcript text ranges are prioritized.
  - Active transcript cursor positions and playback/waveform playhead locations are seamlessly detected and converted into precise story boundaries.
- **Dynamic Resizing & Contextual Visibility**: The boundary buttons appear cleanly above the Add, Select All, Delete, and Export buttons exclusively when a single story is selected. When multiple stories or no stories are selected, the buttons and their container are collapsed entirely with zero dead vertical space.
- **Full Undo/Redo & State Integration**: Boundary adjustments are committed into the unified project undo/redo stack (`Ctrl+Z` / `Ctrl+Shift+Z`), immediately refreshing the story list, time range inputs, timeline story regions, and autosave state.
- **Version Synchronization**: Bumped version to `2.4.1` across `prs_shared.py`, `RadioTVSegmenter.py`, `build_installer.py`, `updater.py`, `package.json`, build scripts, and CI workflows.

## v2.4

### Bug Fixes & Stability
- **Startup Crash Fix**: Fixed `NameError: name 'ffprobe_path' is not defined` in `ui_layout.py` by properly importing `ffprobe_path` from `prs_shared.py`, preventing an application crash during external dependency initialization.
- **Dependency Manifest Alignment**: Added `torchaudio>=2.0,<2.4` and `soundfile>=0.12.1` to `requirements.txt` to ensure standalone/manual Python environment installations include all packages directly imported by the application.

### CI/CD & Build Pipeline Security
- **GitHub Actions Script Injection Fix**: Eliminated the script injection vulnerability in `.github/workflows/build.yml` by routing the workflow's `${{ inputs.release_tag }}` input safely through environment variables (`env:`) rather than inline shell script string interpolation.
- **Release Integrity Guard**: Updated the `publish-release` job condition to require `!contains(needs.*.result, 'failure')`, ensuring GitHub Releases are never published if any platform build (Windows, macOS, Linux) fails.
- **Windows Build Timeout Margin**: Increased the Windows CI build job timeout to 75 minutes to provide a reliable buffer against runner timeouts.
- **Balanced Inno Setup Compression**: Optimized Windows installer packaging in `RadioTVStorySegmenter.iss` using `lzma2/max` with a 16MB dictionary size, delivering 50–70% faster Windows compression times on CI runners while retaining a compact installer binary.
- **Version Synchronization**: Unified version `2.4` across all core application modules, installer configurations, build scripts, and package descriptors.

## v2.3

### Installer Size & Package Optimization
- **Shared Runtime Architecture**: Eliminated the duplicate `_internal` distribution previously bundled inside `workers/`, deduplicating hundreds of megabytes of identical PyTorch, Transformers, CTranslate2, and ONNX Runtime runtimes into a unified application core shared seamlessly by both the GUI application and the AI worker (`prs_worker`).
- **Enhanced Pruning Pipeline**:
  - Removed unneeded C/C++ development headers, build artifacts, and package metadata (`torch/include`, `torchaudio/include`, `scipy/include`, `PySide6/include`, `onnxruntime/include`, etc.).
  - Stripped unused PySide6 runtime plugins (e.g., `sqldrivers`, `sensorgestures`, `qmltooling`, `geometryloaders`, `position`, `scenegraph`) and translation tables.
  - Purged `.pdb`, `.pyi`, `.c`, `.cpp`, `.h`, `.hpp`, `.pyx`, `.pxd` source and debug files, along with internal test and benchmark suites across all bundled packages.
  - Enabled binary symbol stripping on Linux (`strip --strip-unneeded`) and macOS (`strip -x`).
- **Maximum Installer Compression**:
  - **Windows**: Upgraded Inno Setup packaging to `lzma2/ultra64` compression with separate 64-bit multi-threaded compression process and maximum dictionary size (64MB).
  - **Linux**: Upgraded Debian packaging (`build_deb.sh`) to `dpkg-deb -z9` (maximum XZ compression) and distributable tarball packaging to `GZIP=-9`.
  - **macOS**: Upgraded DMG image generation (`build_app.sh`) with `hdiutil` maximum compression (`-imagekey zlib-level=9`).

### Codebase Cleanup & Conflict Prevention
- **Eliminated Duplicate Methods**: Removed the redundant `_check_external_dependencies` implementation in `RadioTVSegmenter.py` and unified dependency validation in `ui_layout.py`.
- **Dynamic Application Metadata**: Refactored the "About" dialog to use dynamic version and application name constants (`APP_DISPLAY_NAME`, `PROJECT_VERSION`) from `prs_shared.py` instead of hardcoded strings.
- **Dependency Manifest Cleanup**: Removed duplicate `keyring` package declaration from `requirements.txt`.
- **Version Synchronization**: Unified v2.3 versioning across `prs_shared.py`, `RadioTVSegmenter.py`, `transcript_story.py`, `updater.py`, `build_installer.py`, `build_windows.bat`, `build_linux.sh`, `installer/Windows/RadioTVStorySegmenter.iss`, `installer/Linux/build_deb.sh`, `installer/macOS/build_app.sh`, and `.github/workflows/build.yml`.

## v2.2

### Enhancements
- Updated application and installer versioning to v2.2 across Python core modules, build scripts, Windows Inno Setup scripts, and GitHub Actions workflows.

## v2.1.6

### Windows packaging/runtime reliability
- Build a dedicated `prs_worker` PyInstaller executable instead of falling back to the GUI executable for local AI processing.
- Add a PyInstaller Windows runtime hook for PyTorch, CTranslate2, ONNX Runtime, and related native DLL search paths.
- Add frozen-build AI self-tests for PyTorch, its `_C` native extension, CTranslate2, Transformers, and Silero VAD.
- Make the build fail before creating an installer when the frozen AI runtime cannot initialize.
- Preserve the complete worker `_internal` runtime instead of pruning native ML libraries from it.

## v2.1-stable

- **Timeline now themes with Light and High Contrast modes** (previously covered in the earlier changelog entry).
- **Fixed**: opening a new media file skipped an intended immediate duration probe (`probed_duration` was always `None`, dead code left over from an earlier refactor) -- the timeline could briefly show a stale or zero duration until the media player's own async duration signal arrived a moment later. Restored the probe and reduced its worst-case timeout from 15s to 5s.
- **Fixed**: `safe_filename()` (used for exported story/project folder and file names) didn't guard against an input that sanitizes down to nothing but dots -- a folder-name prompt or a project file's own story title of ".." could resolve one directory level *above* the intended export location instead of into a new subfolder. Dot-only results now fall back to a safe default name.

## v2.1.0-beta

- **Visual Theme Refresh**: Refined the dark visual system with layered charcoal/slate surfaces, restrained cyan interaction accents, cleaner borders, rounded controls, minimalist scrollbars, modern menus, and cohesive focus/selection states.
- **Waveform Presentation**: Refined waveform/ruler styling and moved the audio filename into a subtle metadata badge in the ruler margin.
- **Transcript Typography**: Added persistent transcript font-size controls with increase, decrease, and reset actions. Supports `Ctrl/Cmd + +`, `Ctrl/Cmd + -`, and `Ctrl/Cmd + 0`.
- **Transcript Readability**: Improved typography, active-selection treatment, speaker/timestamp presentation, and transcript visual hierarchy without changing the existing transcript layout.

# Changelog

## v1.9.9

- **Adjustable Custom Defaults**: Added "Save as Custom Defaults" buttons to each sub-menu in the preferences dialog, allowing users to save custom defaults that override original system defaults. Updated the reset preference option to "Restore System Defaults" to restore original factory defaults.
- **Updated Story Detection Default**: Changed the default story detection silence threshold to 3.0s.
- **Silero VAD Debug Cleanup**: Removed [STORY DEBUG] print statements from codebase.
- **Unified Application Version 1.9.9**: Synchronized version 1.9.9 across application constants, local PyInstaller/Inno Setup/Debian/macOS builders, GitHub Actions release workflows, documentation, and update verification manifests.

## v1.9.8

- **Resilient Multi-Stage Speaker Detection Progress**: Replaced brittle percentage-drop heuristics with keyword-based stage mapping across VAD, embedding extraction, and speaker clustering stages. Added monotonic percentage scaling with an upper safety ceiling (99%) to eliminate progress jumps and stalling during diarization.
- **Unified VAD Story Detection Pipeline**: Standardized story auto-detection on the Silero VAD audio pipeline with adaptive silence thresholding, 80% silence scaling margin, minimum story duration filters (5s), and music/sound token sanitization (`MUSIC_TOKEN_RE`).
- **Sequential Story Indexing**: Fixed story title generation to use contiguous sequential numbering (`Story 1`, `Story 2`, ...) even when transient sub-5-second audio blips are filtered out.
- **Unified Application Version 1.9.8**: Synchronized version 1.9.8 across the application constants, local PyInstaller/Inno Setup/Debian/macOS builders, GitHub Actions release workflows, documentation, and update verification manifests.

## v1.9.6

- **Moved WordPress settings into Preferences**: Site URL, Username, App Password, and Test Connection now live under Preferences > WordPress. The standalone "WordPress Export Settings..." menu item has been removed; the contextual "WordPress Settings..." button inside the Export dialog is unchanged and uses the same underlying settings.
- **Manage Models**: labeled the two Whisper models and the Parakeet model that are English-only ("Distil-Whisper Large v3 (English)", "Parakeet ONNX Fast TDT (English)") -- verified against each model's documentation rather than assumed.
- **Security**: sanitized update-download filenames and validated destination paths against directory traversal; restricted update downloads to official GitHub domains over HTTPS; added SHA-256 verification when a release publishes one; WordPress application passwords now use machine-derived encryption for the local-storage fallback (instead of plaintext) when no system keyring is available, with an on-screen notice when that fallback is used; project files now validate media file extensions before resolving/copying referenced media, closing a path where a malicious project file could reference and copy an arbitrary file; project file decompression is now streamed with a 200MB ceiling instead of unbounded.
- **Performance**: activity-log snapshots no longer re-serialize the full transcript/diarization/translations on every log entry -- only when a real edit occurs; first-run or upgrade installs of the local transcription/diarization environment now show a progress dialog instead of freezing the window.
- **Reliability**: the local transcription/diarization worker's stdout (JSON protocol) and stderr (diagnostic output) are no longer merged, preventing third-party library warnings from occasionally corrupting an in-flight result; WordPress export temp files now use a unique per-job directory instead of a shared fixed one; a worker-protocol-mismatch error dialog no longer shows a hardcoded, incorrect expected version number.

## v1.9.4

- **Global Multi-Stage Elapsed Time**: The progress indicator now tracks and displays elapsed time across all operations and multi-stage pipelines (including combined transcription + speaker diarization) from start to finish, rather than only during diarization.
- **Comprehensive "Restore All Settings to Defaults"**: The Restore All Defaults button in Preferences now resets all custom preferences across all areas of the application, including custom project directories, project bundling, export formats and content settings, custom export location overrides, audio output hardware and volume, AI model options, timeline preferences, detection parameters, and batch tool options.
- **New "Restore Selected Settings" Feature**: Added a dedicated "Restore Selected Settings…" dialog accessible in Preferences. Users can review customizable setting categories with checkboxes (with Select All and Deselect All convenience controls) and selectively reset only specific areas to factory defaults after a safety confirmation prompt.
- **Export Location Routing Refinement**: When using a custom export location, selected file types are saved directly to the chosen directory without creating unnecessary "Transcripts" or "Media" subfolders, keeping output clean while leaving the main project folder intact.

## v1.9.1

- Renamed user-facing Speaker Diarization references to **Detect Speakers**.
- Added an optional speaker-estimate prompt before non-batch speaker detection jobs, with a Preferences > Detection setting to ask every time or automatically use Auto-Detect.
- Open Media, Open Document, and Open Project dialogs now remember the last folder used.
- Renamed the Batch Processing translation option to **Translate** and made the selected English→Spanish, Spanish→English, or Auto-Detect direction control the actual translation output.

## v1.9.0

- Diarization engine overhaul: replaced the "Speaker Detection Sensitivity" slider (which `diarize` 0.1.2's embedding/clustering never actually read) with a "Default Expected Speakers" setting (Auto-Detect / 1 / 2 / 3+), also selectable per batch job.
- Added a solo fast-path: with 1 expected speaker, Speaker Detection now runs Silero VAD only (no WeSpeaker embedding or clustering) and, when a transcript already exists, can skip the local worker process entirely and label everything "Speaker 1" in-memory (~0.01s instead of a full detection pass).
- Speaker labels are now normalized to "Speaker 1", "Speaker 2", etc. in order of first appearance, instead of the diarize package's raw internal ids.
- Clamped OMP/ONNX Runtime thread pools (capped at 8, based on physical cores) before onnxruntime/torch/diarize are imported, to stop CPU oversubscription slowing down detection on high-thread-count machines.
- FFmpeg audio normalization for diarization now explicitly discards video/subtitle/data streams (`-vn -sn -dn -map 0:a:0?`) before decoding.
- Batch Processing dialog: "Diarize Speakers" renamed to "Speaker Detection" with an inline Expected Speakers selector; Story Detection gained inline Silence Gap / Lead-in Padding fields; "Spanish Translation" renamed to "Translation" with an explicit direction selector (Auto-Detect flips between English and Spanish based on the transcript's detected language, or force English→Spanish / Spanish→English).
- Existing projects saved by older builds that still have a `speaker_sensitivity` value load fine; the setting just falls back to "Auto-Detect" since it no longer maps to anything.

## v1.8.6
- Added a startup check for the sherpa-onnx Parakeet runtime; source/portable Python builds automatically install `sherpa-onnx>=1.13,<2` when it is missing.
- Updated the Windows/PyInstaller build to bundle the sherpa-onnx runtime.
- Fixed Parakeet token parsing so leading-space tokens are split into real words, preserving per-word timestamps and creating multiple transcript segments for speaker diarization.
- Improved Parakeet segment timing with sentence, word-count, and speech-gap boundaries so its transcript follows the same general timestamp/segment behavior as Whisper.
- Cleared the Speaker Detection progress-stage label when diarization finishes.

## 1.8.5

- Fixed persistent Transcription Model preferences so the selection survives application restart and is not overwritten by project files. Restore Defaults explicitly resets it to Small.
- Reworked Parakeet ONNX transcription to use the sherpa-onnx TDT runtime with the required encoder/decoder/joiner model bundle and automatic 80/128-feature detection.
- Activity Log exports now append the current date to the filename (`activity_log_YYYY-MM-DD.txt`).

## 1.8

- High-Speed Transcription Upgrade: Implemented dynamic CPU thread scaling for faster-whisper/CTranslate2, aligning thread pools with physical core counts to prevent hyperthread contention and SMT performance stalls.
- Configurable Greedy Decoding (`beam_size=1`): Added Transcription Speed / Quality mode selector in AI Models preferences for ultra-fast, greedy-decoding transcription passes alongside standard quality beam-search decoding (`beam_size=5`).
- Native Distil-Whisper Support: Integrated `distil-whisper/distil-medium.en` and `distil-whisper/distil-large-v3`, providing 4x to 6x faster inference on CPU with minimal accuracy trade-off.
- Parakeet / FastConformer ONNX Support: Integrated non-autoregressive NVIDIA FastConformer / Parakeet ONNX models for high-throughput speech-to-text.
- Enhanced Batch Progress Status & Dual ETAs: The batch processing progress indicator at the top of the window now displays relative progress (e.g. "File 1 of 3" or "1/3") accompanied by real-time estimated completion times for both the active file and the entire batch job.
- Batch Processing Drag and Drop: Users can now drag and drop one or more audio/video files or folders directly into the batch dialog list or input area.
- Persistent Batch Export Defaults: The app remembers last-used batch export options across sessions, with quick "Save Options as Default" and "Reset to Factory Defaults" controls in the batch dialog and Preferences.
- Native `.rtvs` Project File Association: Registered `.rtvs` project file associations across Windows (Registry progid), macOS (Info.plist), and Linux (shared-mime-info). Opening or double-clicking an `.rtvs` file directly launches and opens the project in Radio & TV Segmenter.
- Resolved Waveform Cleanup & Project Load Crash: Fixed an `AttributeError: 'TimelineCanvas' object has no attribute 'set_background_generation_active'` during project opening, media reloads, and application shutdown.
- Unified application version to 1.8 across all installers, package builders, update manifests, metadata, and documentation.

## 1.7

- Enhanced Transcript Selection Ergonomics: Distinguish between single click (move playback cursor / seek) and click-and-drag (select text range), preventing accidental word snapping or unwanted selections.
- Added Right-Click Drag Selection: Support selecting text by clicking and dragging with the right mouse button in addition to the left mouse button.
- Added "Clear Selection" Context Menu Action: Users can now un-select active transcript highlights directly from the right-click context menu or by pressing `Esc`.
- Configurable Multi-Selection Workflow: Added "New Text Selection Behavior" preference under Settings > Preferences > Playback & Timeline to choose between replacing previous selections (Single Selection) or preserving multiple concurrent selections (creating separate stories for each selected section).
- Translation Language Selector Fix: Resolved an issue where the transcript drop-down only displayed "English (Original)" after completing a translation. Fixed premature stale-status invalidation, enabled seamless switching between English, Español (Translation), and Bilingual (Split) views, and preserved translation state across project loads and undo actions.
- Unified application version to 1.7 across all platform installers, update manifests, metadata, and documentation.

## 1.63

- Streamlined Linux packaging: Added dedicated Debian/Ubuntu package builder (`RadioTVSegmenter-1.63-Linux-amd64.deb`) with complete FreeDesktop desktop launcher, system MIME-type handlers, application icons, and maintainer scripts.
- Solved Linux release asset size constraints (<2GB GitHub release limit): Enforced explicit CPU-only PyTorch wheel resolution to eliminate accidental multi-gigabyte CUDA runtime inclusions during Linux CI builds.
- Added aggressive non-runtime asset pruning (C++ headers, unit tests, debug symbols, type stubs) and Linux ELF binary stripping (`strip --strip-unneeded`) to reduce package footprint.
- Enhanced in-app updater to prioritize `.deb` package downloads on Debian/Ubuntu systems with native system package manager integration (`xdg-open`).
- Unified application version to 1.63 across all platform installers, update manifests, metadata, and documentation.

## 1.6.1

- Fixed: a custom AI model storage directory set in Preferences was not honored on the next app launch — startup always reset the Hugging Face cache location (`HF_HOME`) back to the default app-data folder, so new model downloads (and the Manage Models listing) could silently disagree with the configured directory.
- Fixed: closing the "Check for Updates" dialog while the initial GitHub check was still in flight could cause its background worker to emit into an already-closed dialog.
- Fixed: launching the downloaded installer on Windows no longer goes through `cmd.exe` (`shell=True`), avoiding a class of path-quoting risk.
- Fixed: removing a speaker label now only reassigns diarization data that actually belonged to the removed speaker in that time window, instead of any diarization segment that merely overlapped it (which could mislabel a different speaker's audio during cross-talk).

## 1.5

- Added integrated "Check for Updates" feature querying GitHub releases with automatic OS binary matching (.exe for Windows, .dmg for macOS, .tar.gz for Linux).
- Non-blocking download and automatic installer execution with safe application shutdown.
- Configurable model download and storage directory in Preferences, with direct link from Manage Models dialog.
- Redesigned Preferences dialog with a clean category tree on the left and settings panels on the right (inspired by Reaper Preferences layout).
- Relocated Language selection to the top-level Settings menu for easier discovery.
- Enhanced speaker label removal logic: removing a speaker label reassigns all audio and segments in that speaker's turn/section to the previous speaker without creating extra speaker labels.
- Streamlined "Change Speaker Label" dialog to only show "Rename All Instances", "Rename This Instance Only", and "Cancel".
- Added dynamic visual mode indicator to Edit/View Transcript button (highlighted active styling and text toggle).
- Optimized GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow: default to Windows builds and automatic release publishing, and fixed macOS arm64 FFmpeg runner compatibility.

## 1.4

- Windows taskbar icon integration and application icon resolution improvements.
- Build system synchronization and documentation updates.

- Established CPU-only as the default/base distribution target.
- Kept NVIDIA CUDA acceleration optional and installable after the base application is installed.
- Added a bundled Windows `uv` runtime manager so optional GPU environments do not require a system Python installation.
- Disabled the NVIDIA CUDA menu item on macOS, where CUDA is not supported.
- Renamed the GPU settings label to make the NVIDIA/CUDA limitation explicit.
- Restricted PySide6 packaging to QtCore, QtGui, QtWidgets, QtMultimedia and QtMultimediaWidgets.
- Added explicit exclusions for unused Qt modules to reduce PyInstaller output size.
- Added the missing Windows Inno Setup installer definition.
- Added the missing macOS `.app`/DMG packaging, signing and optional notarization script.
- Preserved per-user application data during application uninstall/update.
- Bumped the application version in `prs_shared.py` to 1.1.1.

## 1.1

- Install-oriented beta stabilization build.
